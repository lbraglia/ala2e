Description:

The dataset consists of count data from a placebo-controlled clinical
trial of 30 patients with leprosy at the Eversley Childs Sanitorium in the
Philippines. Participants in the study were randomized to either of two 
antibiotics (denoted treatment drug A and B) or to a placebo (denoted treatment 
drug C). Prior to receiving treatment, baseline data on the number of
leprosy bacilli at six sites of the body where the bacilli tend to
congregate were recorded for each patient. After several months of
treatment, the number of leprosy bacilli at six sites of the body
were recorded a second time. The outcome variable is the total
count of the number of leprosy bacilli at the six sites.
In this study, the question of main scientific interest is whether
treatment with antibiotics (drugs A and B) reduces the abundance
of leprosy bacilli at the six sites of the body when compared to
placebo (drug C).
